# Team Dashboard Interface Design

---

## 🧩 Design Overview
A responsive **Team Dashboard** designed in Figma and implemented using **Bootstrap 5.2**.  
The goal was to demonstrate clear visual hierarchy, usability, and clean code organization.

**Key Features:**
- Responsive grid layout for member cards.
- Filter sidebar with status and team chips.
- “Add Member” CTA and clear page header/footer.
- Hover and active states for improved interaction feedback.

## 🧱 Bootstrap Implementation

### Layout
- Used the **Bootstrap Grid System** (`container`, `row`, `col-12 col-md-6 col-xl-4`) to ensure a responsive layout.
- Left sidebar (`col-lg-3`) and right content area (`col-lg-9`) adapt automatically to smaller screens.

### Components
- Used **cards** (custom div structure styled with Bootstrap utilities) to represent team members.
- **Buttons and chips** use the `btn` and `btn-check` pattern from Bootstrap 5.2 for toggling active states.
- All spacing uses Bootstrap utilities (`g-3`, `my-4`, `fw-bold`, etc.).

### Responsiveness
- Fully responsive across breakpoints: stacks vertically on mobile, grid on desktop.
- Fluid typography and spacing for visual balance.
